player Object:
var player = {};
player.ID = integer; ID number for that tournament. Does not persist outside of a tournament.
player.fullName = string; Likely the most unique identifier outside of a tournament.
player.email = string; Primary contact for player. Should not persist outside of a tournament?
player.short_names = [short_name1,short_name2,etc.]; Array of shortened names of a player. Use the first-most name that doesn't collide with another player. If the player has a nickname, this array will only contain that name.
player.short_name = string; The short name they

// The SQL standard specifies an array column type which PostgreSQL
// supports but MySQL doesn't (yet?). I'll probably use it anyway since
// I'm already using PostgreSQL despite my concerns of keeping the app
// easily portable to MySQL.

// Misc.
Detect pressing tab on the "faction" player detail box with keydown (tab has keyCode 9).
When you switch to Bootstrap, you may need to replace .button().click(... with just click(.

// Home, Load
A drop down that is always open is called a "select"

// Round Draws
Tables that players put their game pieces on are called "maps". Tables that display tabular information are called "tables"
A "pair"ed round is one where each player has been assigned an opponent.
A "draw"n round is on where each player has been assigned an opponent and map (table).

/* Pairing Algorithm Steps:
 * 0. The most wins a player can have is the previous round number.
 * 1. Set the current win bracket to be the current round number. This is to avoid a special case first loop.
 * 2. Reduce the current win bracket by 1.
 * 3. Round down and add random amount between 0.1 and 0 to each player's score.
 * 4. Sort players by their score
 * 5. Check the first player's score. If less than the current win bracket, go to 2.
 * 6. .shift() two players from the array.
 * 7. Check if they can play each other. If they can't, .push() them to the array and go to 3.
 * 8. If there are still players in the array, go to 6
